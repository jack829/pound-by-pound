This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.


This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.11.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
